# PYA

PYA is a prototype of a platform game, where we have to go from a point A to point B, but we don't control the player directly : we must prepare his actions (PYA = Prepare Your Actions), like moving right for 3 seconds, then jumping at a certain angle, then wait...

This prototype is developped on my free time. It will remain free.
But also, I didn't work a lot on this project, I just have the concept.
